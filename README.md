# Hi, I'm Coby! 🤘

I grew up in Sacramento, CA and came up to Tacoma, WA for college and stayed for the beautiful people and summers. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from the University of Puget Sound in 2011.

Here's what I've been working on:

* 🎵 A [prototype](https://github.com/acobster/looper_proto) for `fclooper`, a looping system for live musical performance with some unique features. **Rust**
* 👩‍⚕️ A scheduler application for the Radical Telehealth Collective (currently in Beta with trusted orgs). **Clojure, ClojureScript**
* 🍞 [Bread CMS](https://github.com/breadsystems/bread-cms), a content management system and library built on top of [Datahike](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike). **Clojure**
* 🌺 [Lei](https://lei.tamayo.xyz/), a library for building visual design systems in [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden). **Clojure**
